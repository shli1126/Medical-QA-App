Content: be repeated at the first sign of recurrence of bronchial infection.  
2) Control of bronchospasm: β-agonists like salbutamol, or one of the theophyllines can 
be used. Corticosteroids do not have a major role in maintenance treatment. 
3) Facilitation of drainage of bronchial secretion: adequate hydration with oral fluids is 
essential to prevent drying of secretions.  Inhalation of mist, postural drainage, and 
chest exercise may help. 
4) Hypoxemia: this will lead to cor-pulmonale in patients with predominant c.bronchitis. 
Oxygen should be given in such patients with hypoxia, and in severe cases a portable 
oxygen therapy ( 16 hrs /day) for home use is recommended.                                 
5) Control of heart failure : the most important measures are correction of hypoxemia, 
administration of diuretics and restriction of sodium intake. 
6) Exercise: prolonged inactivity leads to exercise intolerance. Regular exercise as long

• Basic treatment for most patients is symptomatic with bed rest, antipyretics, nasal 
decongestants & steam inhalation.  
 
2.3 Acute Bronchitis 
It is an acute inflammation of the tracheobronchial tree, generally self-limiting and with eventual 
complete healing and return to normal function. It could be caused by infections or irritants.  
Etiology:  
• Acute infectious bronchitis is often part an acute upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). 
It may develop after a common cold or other viral infection of the nasopharynx, throat or 
tracheobronchial tree, often with secondary bacterial infection.  
• Acute irritative bronchitis  is caused by various mineral and vegetable dusts, volatile 
solvents, tobacco or other smoke.  
Symptoms and signs:  
• Acute infectious bronchitis is often preceded by symptoms of URTI, coryza, malaise, 
chilliness, slight fever, back and muscle pain and sore throat.

Course and Prognosis 
In the early stage of COPD, some reversal of airway obstruction and considerable 
symptomatic improvement can often be obtained with therapy, but the long-term prognosis is 
less favorable in such patients.  
Treatment: so far no curative treatment.  
• Therapy is directed at relieving symptoms, controlling potentially fatal exacerbations, 
and slowing of the progression of the disorder.  
• Avoidance of bronchial irritants, especially cessation of smoking, is of primary 
importance. 
Thus, the treatment is outlined as follows: 
1) Treatment of infection: COPD patients with purulent sputum should be treated with a 
broad spectrum antibiotic. Commonly used drugs include co-trimoxazole 980mg 
POBID or TTC or Ampicillin 250 - 500mg four times a day for 10 days. The course can 
be repeated at the first sign of recurrence of bronchial infection.  
2) Control of bronchospasm: β-agonists like salbutamol, or one of the theophyllines can

3) O 2 therapy: may be given in patients with hypoxemia. 
4) Surgical resection  of the affected part is indicated when bronchiectasis is localized, 
and in those with recurrent massive hemoptysis that fails to respond to conservative 
treatment. This is effective if done early in life.
