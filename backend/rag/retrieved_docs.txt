Individuals tend to survive at extremely low hemoglobin levels (even as low as 3 gm %) due to 
these compensatory mechanisms.  
Therapeutic considerations and indications 
In the management of anemic patients carefully remember the following points  
• Identify and correct the cause of anemia  
• Administration of Hematinines such as Iron, Vit B 12 or folate without correct diagnosis 
of the cause of anemia is an unacceptable practice in the treatment of anemia  
• Therapeutic modalities include: Iron, folate, Vit. B 12, pyridoxine (B 6) blood transfusion, 
steroids (in hemolytic anemia) splenectomy, erythropoietin, bone marrow transplant 
(aplastic anemia), and androgens 
• Carefully weigh the risks of blood transfusion over its advantage. 
When to transfuse blood in chronic anemia  
1. Anemia severe enough to cause CHF (congestive heart failure) 
2. Hypoxic manifestations: Irritability, unconsciousness, angina

Content: • Decreased release of iron from macrophages to plasma,  
• reduced RBC life span ( ∼ 80 days) in effective erythropoiesis  
• Inadequate erythropoietin response to anemia  
Treatment of Anemia of Chronic Dideases: 
1. Correction of underlying disease 
2. Erythropoietin (40-80 % success rate) 
3. Correction of reversible contributors (iron, folate, cobalamine supplements if necessary) 
 
C) Sideroblastic anemia: 
• Refractory anemia with hypochromia with ↑ marrow iron  
• Many pathological ring sideroblasts are found in the bone marrow  
• Is caused by defect in hem synthesis  
Classification: 
• Hereditary (sex linked recessive trait) 
• Acquired

Content: • Wrong diagnosis 
• Mixed deficiency – associated folate or vit.B 12 deficiency  
• Another cause for anemia e.g. malignancy, inflammation  
• Malabsorption – rare cause 
• Use of slow release preparations  
Parentral iron  
 Indications:  
1. Oral Iron intolerance despite modification in dosage regimen 
2. Malabsorption 
3. Inability or unwillingness to take orally  
• Iron-dextran complex or iron sorbitol citrate can be used Intra-muscularly or intra-venous 
route. 
Dose (ml) = 0.0442 (desired Hgb – Observed Hgb.) X weight (Kg.) + (0.26 x weight Kg.) 
 
B)  Anemia of chronic diseases (ACD) 
It occurs in association with a variety of chronic inflammatory and malignant diseases.
