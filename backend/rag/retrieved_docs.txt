Watch this video (http://openstax.org/l/tumor) to learn more about tumors. What is a tumor?
Cancer treatments vary depending on the disease’s type and stage. Traditional approaches, including surgery,
radiation, chemotherapy, and hormonal therapy, aim to remove or kill rapidly dividing cancer cells, but these
strategies have their limitations. Depending on a tumor’s location, for example, cancer surgeons may be unable to
remove it. Radiation and chemotherapy are difficult, and it is often impossible to target only the cancer cells. The
treatments inevitably destroy healthy tissue as well. To address this, researchers are working on pharmaceuticals
that can target specific proteins implicated in cancer-associated molecular pathways.

Content: The commnly used combinations of chemotherapy include  
o MOPP: mustine, vincristine (oncovine), procarbatine, predinisolone  
o ABVD : adramycin, bleomycine, vinblastin, decarbazine  
o This combination therapy is either used alone or MOPP – ABVD hybrid given for 
6 cycles (or 4 cycles after full remission). 
3.  Relapse cases are  better treated with autologous Bone marrow transplantation with 
total body irradiation and high dose chemotherapy.   
Prognosis – depends on stage  
Five-year survival being 
 Stages I and II:  85%  
 Stage   III A:  70% 
 Stages III B & IV: 50%

Table VI-2-3. The treatment of acute leukemias (Cytotoxic drugs & phases of treatment).  
  
Phase of treatment ALL AML 
Remission induction Combination of vincristine 
Prednisolone and L 
asparaginase Daunorubucin 
for 4 weeks 
Daunorubucin+ cytosine 
arabinoside 4weeks (called 
3+7 regimen 
Continuation/intensification 
phase 
Combination of 6-
mercaptopurine & 
methotrexate+ Bone marrow 
transplantation 
2-3 intensive cycles of the 
same as above or high dose 
of cytosine arabinoside+ bone 
marrow transplantation for 
young patients 
CNS prophylaxis Radiation to the whole brain 
Combined with intra-thecal 
methotrexate (given by 
lumber puncture) 
No benefit because CNS 
relapse occurs only with 
systemic relapse. Therefore, 
it is not given.  
Maintenance oral 6 -mercaptopurine &  
Methotrexate 
No benefit 
 
B) Supportive treatment is applicable for both ALL & AML

Stage 2:  2 or more lymph node areas on the same side of the diaphragm involved  
Stage 3:   Disease involving lymph nodes above and below diaphragm; splenic 
involvement is included here. 
Stage 4:  Extra-nodal site involvement (Liver, bone marrow and other extra nodal sites) 
Depending on the presence or absence of constitutional symptoms the stages are further 
classified as A (no constitutional symptoms) and B (presence of constitutional symptoms.) 
 
Treatment  
1. Radiotherapy – mainstay for stage I and II diseases; used for stage III and IV with 
chemotherapy. 
2. Chemotherapy  
• Cyclical chemotherapy for stage III and IV diseases  
• In stage I and II patient with bulky disease  
E.g.  - Mediastinal widening by 1/3rd  
Lymph node > 10 cm in diameter 
The commnly used combinations of chemotherapy include  
o MOPP: mustine, vincristine (oncovine), procarbatine, predinisolone  
o ABVD : adramycin, bleomycine, vinblastin, decarbazine
