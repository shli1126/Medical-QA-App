Cancer treatment varies based on the type and stage of the disease, commonly involving surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. Combination therapies like MOPP and ABVD are frequently used, along with newer targeted pharmaceuticals aimed at specific cancer-related proteins. Prognosis is influenced by the cancer stage, with higher survival rates in earlier stages.
