The treatment for bronchitis depends on whether it is acute or chronic bronchitis.

### 1. Acute Bronchitis:
Acute bronchitis is usually self-limiting and often caused by viral infections. The treatment primarily focuses on symptom relief and may include:

- **Symptomatic Treatment**:
  - **Rest**: Adequate rest to allow the body to recover.
  - **Fluids**: Increased oral fluid intake to stay hydrated and help thin mucus.
  - **Antipyretics**: Medications such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen to reduce fever and relieve pain.
  - **Nasal Decongestants**: To relieve nasal congestion.
  - **Cough Suppressants**: If the cough is severe and disrupts sleep, a cough suppressant may be recommended.

- **Inhalation Therapy**: 
  - Steam inhalation or the use of a humidifier can help relieve symptoms by moistening the airways.

- **Avoiding Irritants**: 
  - Avoiding smoke and other environmental irritants can help alleviate symptoms.

- **Antibiotics**: 
  - Antibiotics are generally not recommended for acute bronchitis unless there is evidence of a bacterial infection, which is less common.

### 2. Chronic Bronchitis:
Chronic bronchitis is a long-term condition often associated with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). The treatment aims to relieve symptoms and prevent exacerbations:

- **Smoking Cessation**: 
  - The most crucial step for patients with chronic bronchitis is to quit smoking and avoid exposure to secondhand smoke.

- **Bronchodilators**: 
  - Medications such as Î²-agonists (e.g., salbutamol) or theophyllines may be used to relieve bronchospasm and improve airflow.

- **Corticosteroids**: 
  - Inhaled corticosteroids may be used for patients with frequent exacerbations to reduce inflammation.

- **Oxygen Therapy**: 
  - For patients with hypoxemia, supplemental oxygen may be required.

- **Pulmonary Rehabilitation**: 
  - A program that includes exercise training, nutritional advice, and education to improve quality of life.

- **Vaccinations**: 
  - Annual influenza vaccinations and pneumococcal vaccinations to prevent respiratory infections.

- **Management of Exacerbations**: 
  - Patients with chronic bronchitis should have a plan for managing exacerbations, including the use of antibiotics for bacterial infections.

It is essential for individuals experiencing symptoms of bronchitis to consult with a healthcare provider for accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment tailored to their specific condition.
